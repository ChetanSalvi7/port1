                        <p> Since Adobe Flash was a complete innovation, alongside with CSS 1.0 and HTML 4.01 as standards of the current web I've been passionate about web.

                        </p>
                        <p> For over a decade I had many opportunities to work in a vast spectrum of <a rel="skills" href="#">web technologies</a> what let me gather a significant amount of various experience.
                            Working for companies and individuals around the globe I met and learnt from amazing and ambitious people.
                        </p>
                        <p> I currently work remotely with a selected freelance client base being open for new opportunities.</p>
